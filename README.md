# sales-optimization-coffee-shop
This project analyzes six months of transactional data (January–June 2023) from three New York City locations of Maven Roasters to identify sales drivers, customer purchasing patterns, and operational improvement opportunities.

The objective was to uncover revenue trends, evaluate product and location performance, and develop data-driven recommendations to support inventory planning, staffing optimization, and marketing strategy.

The analysis examines:
Sales and revenue trends by month and location
Product category contribution to revenue and volume
Shift-based purchasing patterns (morning, afternoon, evening)
Product-level performance within each location
Price inconsistencies across stores

Key findings reveal that Coffee (40% of revenue) and Tea (30%) are the primary sales drivers across all locations. Sales peak in June and decline significantly in February, suggesting seasonal influence. Morning shifts generate the highest transaction volume, while evenings show untapped potential. Lower Manhattan consistently underperforms in both revenue and transaction volume compared to Astoria and Hell’s Kitchen.
The analysis also identified recurring price inconsistencies across multiple products and locations, highlighting potential operational or system issues requiring further investigation.
Beyond performance tracking, the project delivers strategic marketing recommendations, including seasonal campaigns, combo promotions to increase average transaction value, delivery platform integration, and targeted efforts to boost underperforming categories such as Drinking Chocolate, Flavours, and Branded Merchandise.

A dynamic Excel dashboard was developed to enable interactive monitoring of KPIs and support informed decision-making.

This project simulates a real-world retail analytics scenario focused on improving profitability through customer behavior insights and operational evaluation.
